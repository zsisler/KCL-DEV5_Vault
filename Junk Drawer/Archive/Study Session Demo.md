Did I mention that it's dev friendly? You can use git and have source control tied to your note taking utilizing a workflow we're familiar with! See: https://github.com/zsisler/Obsidian-Vault

Follow these instructions for git functionality: https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started

```csharp
Console.Writeline("Hello World!");
bool likesObsidian = true;

if(!likesObsidian)
{
	Console.Writeline("You're awesome.")
}
else
{
	Console.Writeline("Sorry ðŸ˜‚")
}
```

```csharp
bool 
```
